## Description
This site primarily contains a list of most of my Epicodus projects completed during week 1. It includes a navigation bar that links to an About Me page and a Contact page. I tried to apply each of the styling elements and all the HTML tags I've learned so far. This website is an exercise in HTML, CSS, and applying bootstrap.

## Setup
Open website in the browser of your choice. I prefer Chrome.

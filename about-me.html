    <h2><strong>About Me:</strong></h2>
      <img src="img/ct.jpg" align="middle">
      <p>You're here because you want to know more about who I am. As you probably already know, my name is Hillary was born and raised in Southern California. I went to college at UCLA, and later earned my Master's degree in English from Loyola Marymount university. In 2013 I moved to Portland, Oregon with my husband, <span style="color: #7300e6">Dave,</span> and our cat, <span style="color: #7300e6">Ella Fitzgerald</span>. In my free time I like to enjoy all Portland has to offer by going to local shows, eating delicious pastries, going for hikes, and reading lots of books.</p>

      <p>I worked in academia for nearly a decade, first as an advisor and later as an English instructor. At first I advised students on course selection and helped run program oprations. Upon earning my Master's I began to teach composition and introductory literature courses to college freshman. So how did I get into coding? I first became interested in coding when I was asked to update the program websites as an advisor using very basic HTML. Then, I started exprimenting with more coding by creating basic web pages for my English courses. I enjoyed the work so much that I began to think more seriously about learning to code. It took several years to convince myself that I wanted to make a full-time career change. So, in 2015, I took a chance and enrolled at Epicodus where I'm now learning to code a lightning speed. Eventually I hope to go into web development and perhaps UX design. I'm excited about this new journey and I hope you enjoy looking over my projects! </p>

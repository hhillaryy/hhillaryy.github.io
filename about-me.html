      <p><em>You're here because you want to know more about who I am. As you probably already know, my name is Hillary. I was born and raised in Southern California. I went to college at UCLA and later earned my Master's degree in English from Loyola Marymount university. In 2013 I moved to Portland, Oregon with my husband, <span style="color: #7300e6">Dave,</span> and our cat, <span style="color: #7300e6">Ella Fitzgerald</span>. In my free time I like to enjoy all Portland has to offer by going to local shows, eating delicious pastries, going for hikes, and reading lots of books in coffee shops or parks.</p>

      <p>Let me tell you a little about my professional background. I worked in academia for nearly a decade, first as an advisor and later as an English instructor. So how did I get into coding? I first became interested in coding as an advisor when I was asked to update the program websites using very basic HTML tags. Then, I started exprimenting with more coding and basic css by creating simple web pages for my English courses. I enjoyed the work so much that I began to think more seriously about learning to code. It took several years to convince myself that I wanted to make a full-time career change. So, in 2015, I took a chance and enrolled at Epicodus where I'm now learning to code at lightning speed. Eventually I hope to go into web development and perhaps UX design. I'm excited about this new journey and I hope you enjoy looking over my projects!</em></p>
